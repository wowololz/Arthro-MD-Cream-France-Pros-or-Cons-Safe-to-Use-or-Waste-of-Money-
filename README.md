**The Growing Problem of Joint Pain in France**

Joint discomfort has become a public health concern in France. According to Santé Publique France, over 10 million individuals experience joint issues annually, with arthritis and osteoarthritis leading the charts. Factors contributing to this rise include:
•	Aging Population: France has one of the highest proportions of seniors in Europe.
•	Lifestyle: Sedentary behavior, poor posture, and obesity strain joints.
•	Sports Injuries: An increase in recreational sports has led to more musculoskeletal injuries.
•	Occupational Hazards: Repetitive movements in certain professions also lead to chronic joint wear.
The demand for non-invasive and safe solutions is evident. While oral painkillers and steroids are widely used, they come with significant side effects. This has paved the way for topical solutions like Arthro MD+ Cream.
